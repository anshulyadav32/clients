/**
 * The PinService is used for PIN-based unlocks. Below is a very basic overview of the PIN flow:
 *
 * -- Setting the PIN via {@link SetPinComponent} --
 *
 *    When the user submits the setPinForm:

 *    1. We encrypt the PIN with the UserKey and store it on disk as `userKeyEncryptedPin`.
 *
 *    2. We create a PinKey from the PIN, and then use that PinKey to encrypt the UserKey, resulting in
 *       a `pinKeyEncryptedUserKey`, which can be stored in one of two ways depending on what the user selects
 *       for the `requireMasterPasswordOnClientReset` checkbox.
 *
 *       If `requireMasterPasswordOnClientReset` is:
 *       - TRUE, store in memory as `pinKeyEncryptedUserKeyEphemeral` (does NOT persist through a client reset)
 *       - FALSE, store on disk as `pinKeyEncryptedUserKeyPersistent` (persists through a client reset)
 *
 * -- Unlocking with the PIN via {@link LockComponent} --
 *
 *    When the user enters their PIN, we decrypt their UserKey with the PIN and set that UserKey to state.
