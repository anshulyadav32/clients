# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the entire Bitwarden client codebase to use TypeScript strict mode. TypeScript strict mode enables a comprehensive set of type checking behaviors that catch common programming errors at compile time, improving code quality, maintainability, and developer experience. The migration will systematically enable strict mode across all applications (browser, web, desktop, CLI) and shared libraries while maintaining functionality and ensuring no regressions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Bitwarden codebase, I want TypeScript strict mode enabled so that I can catch type-related bugs at compile time and have better code safety guarantees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce strict null checks across all source files
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce strict function types checking
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce strict bind/call/apply checks
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce strict property initialization checks
5. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce no implicit any types
6. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce no implicit returns
7. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN the compiler SHALL enforce no implicit this context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing TypeScript configuration files updated to enable strict mode so that the entire codebase benefits from enhanced type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing tsconfig.json files THEN all configuration files SHALL have "strict": true enabled
2. WHEN reviewing tsconfig.json files THEN all strict-related flags SHALL be consistently configured
3. WHEN building any application or library THEN the build process SHALL use strict TypeScript compilation
4. WHEN running tests THEN the test compilation SHALL also use strict mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing code to be compatible with strict mode so that the migration doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enabling strict mode THEN all existing TypeScript files SHALL compile without strict mode errors
2. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN the fixes SHALL maintain existing functionality
3. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN the fixes SHALL not introduce runtime regressions
4. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN the fixes SHALL follow TypeScript best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic approach to fixing strict mode violations so that the migration is manageable and trackable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating code THEN strict mode violations SHALL be fixed incrementally by library/application
2. WHEN migrating code THEN each fix SHALL be isolated and testable
3. WHEN migrating code THEN priority SHALL be given to core libraries before applications
4. WHEN migrating code THEN the migration SHALL start with libraries that have fewer dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing during the migration so that I can be confident no functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN existing unit tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN integration tests SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully for all applications
4. WHEN fixing strict mode violations THEN type checking SHALL pass without errors or warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the migration process so that I understand what changes were made and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN there SHALL be documentation of common strict mode patterns used
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN there SHALL be guidelines for maintaining strict mode compliance
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN there SHALL be examples of how strict mode violations were resolved
4. WHEN encountering complex strict mode issues THEN there SHALL be documented solutions and rationale
